# pride-emoji-flags
A simple repository by [JoyPixels](https://www.joypixels.com) to provide a fully-inclusive set of pride emoji flags.

## what's included?
All 18 flags in SVG and PNG (512px) format within the repository, as well as attached to [each release](https://github.com/joypixels/pride-emoji-flags/releases) 
in zip format for easy download.

## how can I use them?
These flags have not been recommended for general use (RGI) by Unicode, meaning there is
no globally shared emoji code point by which they can be referred. A [petition](https://www.change.org/p/pride-flag-emojis?recruiter=971295933&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink)
exists to help drive the movement for inclusion into Unicode.

## can I contribute?
We gladly accept design suggestions and bug fixes! If you see an issue with any of the artwork please [submit an issue](https://github.com/joypixels/pride-emoji-flags/issues) 
and let us know what needs fixed up. You may also submit a pull request that includes the fixes. Keep in mind that
 to maintain the image quality it is best to modify the SVG file and submit updates that way.
